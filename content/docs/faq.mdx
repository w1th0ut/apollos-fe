# FAQ

## Why create docs as separate MDX files?

It keeps content modular and easier to maintain by topic.

## How do I add a new page?

1. Create a new `.mdx` file inside `content/docs`.
2. Add the page slug to `content/docs/meta.json`.
3. Restart dev server if needed.

## Can this layout be made closer to GitBook style?

Yes. Sidebar groups, typography scale, and color tokens can be tuned further without changing the content model.

## Is search already available?

Yes. Search endpoint is exposed at `/api/search` and wired into the docs layout.

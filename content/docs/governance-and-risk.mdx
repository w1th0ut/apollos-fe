# Governance and Risk

Every strategy decision has risk tradeoffs. This section outlines what users should evaluate.

## Risk Areas

### Smart Contract Risk

Protocol contracts may include implementation or integration risk.

### Liquidity Risk

Shallow markets can increase slippage and exit friction.

### Cross-Chain Risk

Bridge operations include additional execution and settlement dependencies.

## Governance Participation

Governance aligns long-term protocol direction with community input.

- monitor proposals
- evaluate parameter changes
- vote based on risk/reward impact

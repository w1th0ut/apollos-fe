    question: "What is Apollos Finance?",
    answer:
      "Apollos Finance is a next-generation yield protocol built on Arbitrum. We act as a \"smart hedge\" fund for your liquidity. Unlike standard AMMs, Apollos uses a unique leverage strategy to neutralize Impermanent Loss and integrates Gemini AI via Chainlink Workflows to protect your profit from arbitrage bots (LVR). It's the smarter, safer way to provide liquidity on Uniswap V4.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Apollos reduce Impermanent Loss (IL)?",
    answer:
      "We use a 2x Leverage Strategy. Instead of just depositing your own assets, our Vault borrows stablecoins (USDC) from Aave to pair with your volatile assets (ETH/BTC/LINK). This mechanism balances your price exposure, creating a \"linearized yield\" curve. Essentially, you get the benefits of earning trading fees without worrying about your asset ratio changing drastically when the market moves.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is LVR and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "LVR (Loss-Versus-Rebalancing) is the \"invisible tax\" that Liquidity Providers pay to arbitrage bots during market volatility. When prices crash on Binance, bots race to trade against your stale liquidity on-chain, stealing your value. Apollos matters because we block this. Our AI detects volatility and triggers our Uniswap V4 Hooks to raise fees instantly, forcing bots to back off so the profit stays with you.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI protect my funds?",
    answer:
      "We utilize Chainlink Workflows powered by Gemini AI as an automated \"Risk Analyst\". This system monitors off-chain market data (like Binance prices) 24/7. If it detects high volatility or a market crash, the AI calculates a risk score and instructs our smart contracts to enable defensive measures—such as increasing swap fees up to 50%—to prevent predatory trading before it happens.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I deposit from other chains?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You don't need to manually bridge funds. Apollos integrates Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol). You can simply send USDC from supported chains and our protocol will automatically \"zap\" your funds into the Apollos Vault on Arbitrum in a single transaction. It's seamless and hassle-free.",
